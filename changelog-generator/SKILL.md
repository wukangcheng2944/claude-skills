# Changelog Generator

This skill transforms technical git commits into polished, user-friendly changelogs that your customers and users will actually understand and appreciate.


## Agent-First Output Rule

This skill should not only emit polished release notes. It should also help the next agent see which commit range, release boundary, or ambiguous item still needs review before publishing.

When returning a changelog draft, make these explicit:
- `suspected_scope`: the exact release range, product area, or commit cluster being summarized
- `strongest_evidence`: the commit(s), diff pattern, or release marker that most strongly justify the grouping
- `next_best_action`: the single next review or publishing step
- `next_target`: the exact commit, version tag, date range, or draft section to inspect next
- `confidence`: high, medium, or low

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing release notes for a new version
- Creating weekly or monthly product update summaries
- Documenting changes for customers
- Writing changelog entries for app store submissions
- Generating update notifications
- Creating internal release documentation
- Maintaining a public changelog/product updates page

## What This Skill Does

1. **Scans Git History**: Analyzes commits from a specific time period or between versions
2. **Categorizes Changes**: Groups commits into logical categories (features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, security)
3. **Translates Technical 鈫?User-Friendly**: Converts developer commits into customer language
4. **Formats Professionally**: Creates clean, structured changelog entries
5. **Filters Noise**: Excludes internal commits (refactoring, tests, etc.)
6. **Follows Best Practices**: Applies changelog guidelines and your brand voice

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```
